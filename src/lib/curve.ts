 * Catmull-Rom through every point, converted to cubic Béziers.
 *
 * Hourly averages drawn as straight segments read as a saw rather than as a
 * sun crossing a roof. The spline overshoots slightly either side of a sharp
 * change — at dawn and dusk, mostly — so anything using it should clip to its
 * plot area rather than trusting the curve to stay inside the data's range.
 *
 * Shared because the section tiles and the day chart plot the same readings at
 * different sizes, and a sparkline that curves differently from the chart it
 * summarises is quietly lying about the shape of the day.
