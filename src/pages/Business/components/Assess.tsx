/**
 * The same assessment the two consumer journeys run, pointed at a company.
 *
 * That is not a saving in code so much as a statement about the product: a
 * business is profiled the way a property is, and the answers feed the same
 * intelligence loop. The questions are about a portfolio and a process rather
 * than a roof and a tariff, and nothing else about the mechanism changes.
 *
 * It sits here, after the console rather than before it, because the order is
 * the argument. Six questions asked of somebody who has not yet seen what they
 * are for is a form; the same six asked of somebody who has just operated the
 * thing are the obvious next click.
