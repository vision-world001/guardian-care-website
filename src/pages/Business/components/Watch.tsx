/**
 * What it watches, so that nobody has to.
 *
 * Six conditions, five words each. The specification behind this page lists
 * ten and explains each one, which is correct for a specification and wrong
 * here — a reader scanning six short lines takes in the shape of the whole
 * rules engine in about four seconds, and a reader given ten paragraphs takes
 * in none of it.
 *
 * The second half of every tile is the half that matters. Detection on its own
 * moves work from the customer to the operator rather than removing it, so
 * each condition names what the platform does about it, and two of the six
 * resolve without anybody leaving the office — which is the line an operations
 * manager will actually repeat to their finance director.
