/**
 * The gap, and the whole page in one number.
 *
 * This is the app's own worked example: a system generating 62% of the figure
 * it was sold on, twelve years after anybody last compared the two. It is the
 * most persuasive thing Guardian Care has, and the site had never said it.
 *
 * Deliberately almost wordless. A homeowner does not need the mechanism
 * explained — they need to see the two bars at the same scale and feel the
 * distance between them. Everything the page says afterwards is downstream of
 * that feeling, so nothing here competes with it.
 *
 * No money figure. The shortfall is worth a different amount at every tariff,
 * and inventing an average pound sign here would trade the one number that is
 * real for one that is not.
